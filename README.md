# Computer Networks

Notes for learning networks

## Prerequisites

To understand many topics in networking, you will need to have a firm grasp of Numeral systems and conversions between them.  
In particular, you should be comfortable converting decimal (up to 300) to binary and hexadecimal on paper or in your mind, and vice versa.

For example, you should be able to calculate the following:

`223 = 0b11011111 = 0xDF`  
`53 = 0b110101 = 0x35`

### Required software

You will need the following software for learning computer networks:

* [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html)
